Hola, my name is Eric ( github@eric0202 ). An outcome of liberal education and science combined.



There are so much in this world to be explored, as much as the beautiful things to be admired, and those great things to be learned.



I am attracted to quite a lot of things, during my high school, I had been learning `Spanish` for a while. And English is the thing that I was always good at, I founded a subtitle group for English translations, also was I interested in bodybuilding, worked as a personal trainer in a commercial gym, and got the second place in an easier version of crossfit games between colleges.

Also I've learned many programming languages, including `Java`, `C/C++`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, alongside other techs like `Linux`, `Css`, `Html`, `Android`, `miniprogram`, `qt`. 

Once very luckily I got a chance to take part in `bytedance` 's Android training program. As I can recall, I hadn't been busier in any other time of my life , wake up and start working at a little bit over 7 am, stop at about 0 am. Because I got other tasks other than Bytedance's training, I was literally doing 2 full-time jobs. As the outcome of my consistent working , I got the third place in Android program and finished other tasks well. Then I setup my future course mainly towards `embedded Linux`, `C++`, and `Qt` while staying interested in other techs.

My internship was in `Kingtronics Group` Limited Inc ( XiaMen ) , as a Linux engineer, during that period, I've made a giant leap in upgrading my abilities in `Linux` and other aspects. My abilities in solving problems are well approved by my leader, it was a valuable period in my life.



By now , through my dedication and consistence, I have programmed several meaningful apps, also have I created my website for [Personal Blog](https://zeknes.github.io) . I will upload my knowledges and works to my Personal Blog , hope they will be useful to you. In the future there will be more things to be done , goals to be realized. and finally , with a line from Xiaomi that I love -



> **Be always hopeful, the good things are about to happen.**
